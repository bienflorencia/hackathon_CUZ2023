```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Carga de datos

```{r data}
d <- read_csv(
  "data/observations-376080.csv.zip",
  col_types = cols(
    observed_on_string = col_skip(),
    observed_on = col_skip(),
    time_observed_at = col_datetime(format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"),
    image_url = col_skip(), sound_url = col_skip()
  )
)
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
